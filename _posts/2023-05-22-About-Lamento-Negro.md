To discuss **Lamento Negro**, it’s essential to address **Peixinhos**, a neighborhood on the border between Recife and Olinda, steeped in history. It emerged as an extension of **Quilombo Catucá** and was officially founded as a neighborhood in the late **19th century**, taking its poetic name from the Beberibe River (known as the "river of little fish"). The neighborhood’s establishment coincided with the start of construction of the **Olinda Municipal Industrial Slaughterhouse** (which, by the turn of the **21st century**, would become the Nascedouro).

Since the **early 20th century**, the neighborhood has been marked by **contradictions**, such as the creation of the **Municipal Slaughterhouse**, the **Santa Maria Tannery**, and, by mid-century, **Fosforita Olinda S/A**, which made Peixinhos internationally known as a **source of phosphate**.

In the 1970s, the slaughterhouse, Fosforita, and the tannery were shut down, leaving Peixinhos on the periphery of capitalism’s periphery, vulnerable to all ensuing implications and cyclical crises.

However, these hardships fostered a **unique sense of community** in Peixinhos, which organized itself in various ways—from the fight against the **waste transfer station** to the creation of **athletic and cultural associations**.

In the **1980s**, Peixinhos faced the crisis diagnosed in the **Mangue Manifesto**. As part of this **clogged city**, it was plagued by **high rates of unemployment and violence**. It was in this context that **Lamento Negro** emerged—**born as an Afoxé** and evolving into a **social initiative** for the community. Though it became known for its **samba-reggae** beat, it was not a samba-reggae bloc. The band incorporated elements of **coco**, **Afro-Brazilian rituals**, **maracatu**, **ciranda**, and **samba de roda**, becoming a stronghold for these **ancestral expressions**.

It was in this environment that **Chico Science and Lamento Negro** arose, blending funk, rock, hip-hop, and samba-reggae with strong political expression. This project would later become Chico Science & Nação Zumbi. The distinct Mangue sound present in Nação Zumbi is directly linked to Lamento Negro’s roots.
